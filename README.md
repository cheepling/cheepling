I'm a person interested in learning to program, and enjoy creating music and games (especially 8-bit). 
I'm better at Python than at most other languages, but I've done a couple of things in HTML, CSS and Javascript before.
I'm currently exploring the pygame module for Python, and am also trying to create some basic discord bots based off games I've made.
